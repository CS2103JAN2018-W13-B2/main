== PROJECT: Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC)

---

== Overview

Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: overhauled UI to a three panel system and binds UI elements to data in the Model component and ensuring that updates to data is reflected in the UI.
** What it does: A three panel system displaying stored persons, events and attendees offers an intuitive user experience.
** Justification: The previous UI of a Person panel and browser panel does not meet the needs of EPIC's use case.
** Highlights: Leveraged several patterns such as the Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern, Observer Pattern and JavaFx Beans Convention to elegantly trigger UI updates upon data changes.
* *Minor enhancement*: added the `list-event` command that lists all events stored in EPIC
