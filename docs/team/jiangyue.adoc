== PROJECT: EPIC

---

== Overview

EPIC is an event planning tool for large organisations hosting many large-scale events (e.g. schools which host competitions, award and graduation ceremonies, and seminars and talks). It is targeted at and optimised for event planners who are comfortable with using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *commands to modify EpicEvents in the event list*
** What it does: allows the user to locate an event with `find-event` command and then to modify the located event by deleting the event or editing the information of the event with `delete-event` and `edit-event` respectively.
** Justification: These commands are essential to our product because EPIC is targeting at event planners who manage many events. Hence, event planners should be able to find the event they want to modify from multiple events easily and edit or delete an existing event as needed.
** Highlights: This enhancement provides several basic functions for EPIC so that further enhancements that interact with events in EIPC can build on it.

* *Minor enhancement*: maintained the persistent storage of EPIC so that data is retained after EPIC being closed and users can continue their edits when they open the app next time.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/jiangyue12392.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/jiangyue12392.md[Test code]]
