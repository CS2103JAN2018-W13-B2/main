== PROJECT: Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC)

---

== Overview

Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the `toggle` command to toggle attendance of participants to events.
** What it does: Allows the user to toggle the attendance of a participant based on their index in the Attendance Panel.
It toggles the attendance of a participant from attended to not attended and vice versa. It also supports undoing and redoing in both directions.
** Justification: It is one of the essential functionalities of EPIC.
** Highlights: Updated the structure of the app and added an Attendance class in order
to support all operations related to attendance.
* *Minor enhancement*: Updated the structure of the app and added an EpicEvent class in order
to support all operations related to events. Added the `add-event` command to support adding of
events to EPIC.
