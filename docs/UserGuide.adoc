== Introduction

Event Planning isn’t Complicated (EPIC) is a desktop application used for *event planning
and registration for large organisations*.
EPIC is optimized for event planners who prefer typing to using the mouse.
If you can type fast, EPIC can get your event planning tasks and registration processes for
events done faster than traditional (Graphical User Interface) GUI applications
or pen and paper registration.

This user guide will walk you through setting up EPIC on your computer, navigating within the
GUI, using the various features EPIC has.

== Quick Start

This section walks you through setting up EPIC on your computer, and goes through some example commands you can try.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `EPIC.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Event Planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Event Planner.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== How to Use the GUI

This section describes the components of the GUI, and common ways to interact with it.

=== Layout

.Components of the GUI
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

* The top of the GUI is the command box, where you can see commands as you are typing them.
* The main part of the GUI is split into three panes.
** The leftmost pane is the Persons Pane. It displays the list of persons stored in EPIC.
** The middle pane is the Events Pane. It displays the list of events stored in EPIC.
** The rightmost pane is the Attendees Pane. It displays the list of registered persons in the selected event.

[TIP]
The lists displayed in the panes can be filtered using the `find` or `find-event` commands!

=== Interacting with the GUI

* Clicking on an event in the Events Pane selects that event, allowing you to see all persons registered for that event in the Attendees Pane,
as well as perform actions such as toggling attendance.
Selecting an event can also be done with the `select` command in the command box.
* Clicking on the tick/cross symbol next to a person's details in the Attendees Pane allows you to toggle
that person's attendance for the currently selected event.
Toggling the attendance can also be done with the `toggle` command.

== Features

This section details the various features EPIC supports.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
